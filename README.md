### Introduction

This project was made for the Software Engineering class lectured by the Dr. Elder José Reioli in 2019/1 period of the Computing Science at the Federal University of São João del-Rei.

The objective of this project was to make a web application to sell vehicles online where people can signup to negotiate.

### Technologies

As this web application turns out to be a MPA, the technologies used in the frontend are:

* HTML5
* CSS3
* Vue.js 2 library
* Axios 0.18.0
* Bootstrap 4
* EstateAgency theme and template downloaded from [Bootstrapmade](https://bootstrapmade.com/real-estate-agency-bootstrap-template/)
* FontAwesome
* Ionicons
* Notify plugin
* jQuery 3.3.1 library

As about the backend technologies, they are:

* PHP 7.2
* MySQL 5.7
* PDO MySQL PHP Driver

### Installation

In order to install the application, you first will need to run the SQL Scripts inside the `db` folder, to properly create and populate the database. It is also important that you have a HTTP server which runs PHP and have the PDO MySQL Driver plugin installed.

After, you can just copy the rest of the files (except the `db` folder) to the directory where your HTTP server runs PHP files.
